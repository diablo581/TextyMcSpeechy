## How to modify pronunciation 
- Thanks to Thorsten Mueller for this helpful [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=493xbPIQBSU) which gives tips on how to add custom pronunciation rules to `espeak-ng`, which `piper` relies on.
- If you notice that words aren't being pronounced correctly even when they appear multiple times in your dataset, it is likely because the phonemes supplied by `espeak-ng` are incorrect.
- I will provide a guide for correcting pronunciation once I have this figured out myself!
